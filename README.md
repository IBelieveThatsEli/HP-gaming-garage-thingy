Ye this is a game engine im creating. 
At first i created this game engine for a single goal in mind, but ended up trying to keep it modularised so that, hopefully, anyone can make use of and easily add models and game aspect things.
The game engine is code based, no fancy unreal engine gui.
umm what else... created using opengl, glm, glad, glfw, stb and mabe some other things
